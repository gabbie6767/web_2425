    <h2>My 3 Favorite Classes Right Now at EPS</h2>
    <img src="images/EPS sign.png" width="300">
    <p>Study Hall</p>
    <p>This may seem silly that my favorite class is doing nothing, but its true. I look forward to having a carved out time taht I can complete homework. I am very busy at home and rarley have a day after school with nothing to do. As an 8th grader, my homework load has changed tremendously since my past middle school years. I always feel productive in study hall and enjoy the feeling going homeknowing I won't be up late studying or doing homework after extra crictulars.</p>
    <p>Math</p>
    <p>I've always grown up loving math and enjoyed going to math class. I like how Ms. Aguiar teaches and she helps me understand the material well. I enjoying being independant and solving problems on my own and I know that is why I enjoy Ms. Aguiars class. Homework can make or break a class, Ms. Aguar does a great job of assing enough homework where I will understand the subject but not over load my schedule.</p>
    <p>WEB</p>
    <p>My dad enjoys and knows how to code, so I was exited that I could share code with him. He has helped wth with errors that I couldnt fix or didnt have time to ask Ms. Hollingshead in class. I enjoy the why class is set-up and the independace that comes with it. Its great that I can go home and tell my family, "Im making a website!".</p>
